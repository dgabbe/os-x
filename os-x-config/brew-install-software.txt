======================================================
On laptop - move location of Caskroom!

Reinstall mactex (or is it TexShop) w/brew

More apps to reinstall:
microsoft-office-2011, cord, bbedit,
diffmerge, mysqlworkbench, banktivity, adobe-air, balsamiq-mockups

3rd batch of casks:
lockdown, knockknock, ransomwhere, bash-git-prompt??, whatsyoursign, beyond-compare

# Problems w/casks:
# sandbox, sketchup, vuescan

# Screen sharing (a la Screenhero):
# uberconfenence.com (use Chrome browser)
# use-together (didn't find a cask)

check configuration of 1Password defaults: ws.agile.1Password, also look in prefs file.

================================================
brew upgrade
brew cu -a # update all casks, including auto-update apps.
