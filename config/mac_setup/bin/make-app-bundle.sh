# arg1: name of .dist file, generated by Nuitka
# arg2: app dir, directory where app bundle is stored

# Assumptions:
# * Info.plist is located in same directory as .dist bundle
# * app bundle has the same name as .dist bundle

# check on whether cp preserves or creates new file creation date.


# verify .dist file exists
# verify app directory exists
#    create if it doesn't
# app-name = stripe file name from .dist

# move existing file to old file - append date/time to end
